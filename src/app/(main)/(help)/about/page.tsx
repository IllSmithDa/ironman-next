          The reference can be read in two ways. One way is to select a topic on the left hand side of the app where you can see each concept done in various programming languages. It is important that make sure to consult documentation for further analysis and clarification on the distinctions of a concept if the user is learning the language for the first time or is not familiar with the parituclar distinctions of a programming language.

          The Top right dropdown will allow users to select a programmining language and select it to see all the different concepts on one page for that particular programming langauge. This view is good if you want to focus on just one particular language while the concept view allows you to compare syntax between various programming languages
