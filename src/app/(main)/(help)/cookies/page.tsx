        >1. What are Cookies?</h3>
        <p>
          Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They help the website remember your actions and preferences over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another. </p>
        <p>
          For example, the first time a user visits a site, they may choose a username which is stored in the cookie, and then provide data such as password, name, address, preferred font size, page layout, etc. This information would all be stored on the database using the username as a key. Subsequently when the site is revisited the server will read the cookie to find the username, and then retrieve all the user’s information from the database without it having to be re-entered.</p>
